## Walking in Faith

Today we explored what it means to walk by faith and not by sight. Faith is the foundation of our relationship with God and the key to experiencing His promises in our lives.

### Key Points

1. **Faith is the substance of things hoped for** - Our faith gives substance to our hopes and dreams in God
2. **Faith pleases God** - Without faith, it is impossible to please Him
3. **Faith requires action** - True faith moves us to step out in obedience

### Discussion Questions

- What area of your life requires a step of faith right now?
- How can you grow in trusting God more fully?
- What promises of God are you holding onto by faith?

### Prayer

Lord, help us to walk by faith and not by sight. Strengthen our trust in You and help us to step out in obedience to Your calling. Amen.
