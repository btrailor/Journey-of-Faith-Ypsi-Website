## Love One Another

This week we examined the powerful call to love one another as God has loved us. Love is not just a feeling, but an action that reflects God's character.

### Key Points

1. **God is love** - Love originates from God's very nature
2. **We love because He first loved us** - Our ability to love comes from experiencing God's love
3. **Perfect love casts out fear** - God's love frees us from fear and anxiety

### Practical Application

- Show love through acts of service this week
- Forgive someone who has hurt you
- Pray for those who are difficult to love

### Reflection

Take time this week to meditate on how God has shown His love to you. Let that love overflow into your relationships with others.
