### Community Group Values

Our groups are guided by these values:

**Confidentiality** - What's shared in the group stays in the group

**Authenticity** - We create space for honesty about struggles and questions

**Grace** - We extend grace to ourselves and others as we grow

**Participation** - Everyone's voice matters; everyone has something to contribute

**Flexibility** - Life happens; we support one another through busy seasons
