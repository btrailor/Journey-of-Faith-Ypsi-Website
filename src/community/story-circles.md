## Story Circles

Story Circles are gatherings where we share our stories and listen deeply to one another, building empathy, understanding, and connection.

---

### What Are Story Circles?

Story Circles are structured conversations where participants:

- Share personal stories around a theme or question
- Practice deep, compassionate listening
- Build understanding across differences
- Recognize God's work in one another's lives
- Create space for voices that are often unheard

---

### Why Stories Matter

Stories are powerful. They:

- Help us see the image of God in one another
- Build bridges across differences
- Create empathy and understanding
- Connect us to the larger story God is writing
- Transform how we see ourselves and others

In a world of quick judgments and shallow interactions, Story Circles create space for the kind of deep listening that changes us.

### How Story Circles Work

**The Format:**

1. **Opening** - We create a hospitable space and set guidelines for listening
2. **Prompt** - A question or theme is offered (e.g., "Tell about a time you experienced unexpected grace")
3. **Sharing** - Each person shares their story (3-5 minutes)
4. **Listening** - Others listen without interrupting, fixing, or advising
5. **Reflection** - Brief time to reflect on what we've heard
6. **Closing** - We give thanks for the stories shared

**Guidelines:**

- Listen with curiosity and compassion
- Honor confidentiality
- Speak from your own experience ("I" statements)
- Don't interrupt, fix, or give advice
- Make space for silence
- Honor the time limits

- Our experiences matter
- God is at work in unexpected ways
- We have more in common than we thought
- Everyone has wisdom to share
