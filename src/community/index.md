## Community

Faith is meant to be lived in community. At Journey of Faith, we create spaces for authentic relationships, mutual care, and growing together.

### Why Community Matters

We believe following Jesus isn't meant to be done alone. In community, we:

- Share joys and burdens
- Grow in faith together
- Experience belonging and acceptance
- Discover our gifts and callings
- Practice loving one another
- Become more like Christ

Whether you're an extrovert or introvert, new to faith or a lifelong believer, there's a place for you in our community.
