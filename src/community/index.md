### Why Community Matters

We believe following Jesus isn't meant to be done alone. In community, we:

- Share joys and burdens
- Grow in faith together
- Experience belonging and acceptance
- Discover our gifts and callings
- Practice loving one another
- Become more like Christ

Whether you're an extrovert or introvert, new to faith or a lifelong believer, there's a place for you in our community.
