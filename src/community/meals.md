## Community Meals

Sharing meals is a sacred practice. At Journey of Faith, we gather around tables to break bread, build relationships, and practice the hospitality of Jesus.

---

### Why We Share Meals

In Scripture, some of the most important moments happen around a table:

- Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners
- The early church shared meals in one another's homes
- The kingdom of God is described as a great banquet

When we eat together, we:
- Build relationships across differences
- Practice hospitality and welcome
- Slow down and be present with one another
- Remember that God provides for our needs
- Create space for authentic conversation
