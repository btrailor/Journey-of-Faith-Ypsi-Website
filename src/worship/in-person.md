- We celebrate communion every Sunday
- All are welcome to participate, regardless of church membership or denomination

- If you prefer not to take communion, you're welcome to remain seated or come forward for a blessing

### Music

[Describe your music style and approach]

Example:
Our worship includes a blend of:

We believe music is a gift that helps us connect with God and one another. Sing along or simply listen - both are valid forms of worship.

We'd love to get to know you!
