### Parking

- Accessible parking spots are located near the main entrance

### What to Wear

You'll see everything from jeans and t-shirts to dresses and suits. Wear whatever makes you comfortable. God cares about your heart, not your wardrobe.

### Children in Worship

**All ages are welcome in worship!**

[Describe your approach to children in worship]

Example options:
- Children are welcome and encouraged to participate in worship with their families
- Activity bags are available at the entrance for younger children
- A nursery is available for infants and toddlers (ages 0-3)
- Children's church is offered for ages 4-10 during the sermon
- Family restrooms are located [location]

We believe children belong in worship and expect them to make joyful noise! Don't worry if your little one is restless - we're glad you're here.

### Communion

**Everyone is welcome at the table**

[Explain your communion practice]

Example:
- We celebrate communion every Sunday
- All are welcome to participate, regardless of church membership or denomination
- We offer both bread and grape juice
- Gluten-free options are available
- If you prefer not to take communion, you're welcome to remain seated or come forward for a blessing

We believe the table belongs to Jesus, not to us, and all are welcome.

### Music

[Describe your music style and approach]

Example:
Our worship includes a blend of:
- Contemporary worship songs
- Traditional hymns
- Songs from diverse cultural traditions
- Occasional special music from talented members

We believe music is a gift that helps us connect with God and one another. Sing along or simply listen - both are valid forms of worship.

### Fellowship

**Stay for coffee and connection!**

After worship, we gather for coffee, tea, and conversation. This is a great time to:
- Meet people and make connections
- Ask questions about Journey of Faith
- Connect with our pastor
- Enjoy refreshments

We'd love to get to know you!

1. Greeters will welcome you at the door
2. Pick up a bulletin with the order of worship
3. Find a seat anywhere - there are no assigned seats!
