### What to Expect

Visiting a new church can feel intimidating. Here's what to expect when you join us on Sunday morning:

- - -

### When & Where

**Sunday Mornings at 10 am**

2310 Packard Rd. 
Ypsilanti, MI

- - -

### Parking

We have a parking lot, so parking is free and easy. 

The best way to enter the building is through the back door, at the top of the ramp. That goes straight into the back of our worship space!

If it’s easy for you to walk, please park closer to the front of the lot (near where you enter off Packard). 

There are three handicap spots at the back of the lot near the ramp.

### What to Wear

Most people wear casual, everyday clothing to worship at Journey of Faith, so you can wear whatever you want! (Assuming it’s appropriate for the public of course)  Jeans, shorts, dresses, a tux or an evening gown. If your kid loves wearing PJ’s, they can even come in their “comfy-cozies.” It’s totally up to you!

### Children in Worship

**All ages are welcome in worship!**

We do not have a separate program during worship for our kids. We want children to feel welcome and included in our worship. Our children are invited to read the scripture and call to worship, and help serve communion. We always provide an area for kids to keep their hands busy and are continually learning how to practice biblical story-telling and providing teaching in worship that connects with people of all ages.

We believe children belong in worship and expect them to make joyful noise! Don't worry if your little one is restless - we're glad you're here.

### Communion

**Everyone is welcome at the table**

We celebrate communion every Sunday and all are welcome to participate, regardless of church membership or denomination. Our communion elements are usually bread baked by a congregant and grape juice in small glasses. We would be happy to provide a gluten-free option if requested. Participants come forward to receive communion or can raise their hand if they need the elements brought to them. 

We believe the table belongs to Jesus, not to us, and all are welcome.

### Music

Did you know that singing with others is good for your health? We emphasize participation, rather than performance and believe music is a gift that helps us connect with God and one another. Our worship includes a blend of contemporary worship songs, gospel music, spirituals, and traditional hymns. We typically have a guitarist, pianist, and singer leading us in worship and we LOVE hearing everyone’s voice singing together.

### Fellowship

**Stay for coffee and connection!**

After worship, we gather for coffee, tea, and conversation. We hope you stay to meet other congregants. Everyone’s pretty friendly. If you are interested in the church or just want to chat, feel free to say hi to our pastor and set up a time to get a drink together. We'd love to get to know you!

### Your First Visit

When you arrive:

1. Greeters will welcome you at the door
2. Pick up a bulletin with the order of worship
3. Find a seat anywhere - there are no assigned seats!
4. Feel free to participate as much or as little as you're comfortable with

Don't worry about knowing when to stand, sit, or what to say. Just follow along and participate at your comfort level.
