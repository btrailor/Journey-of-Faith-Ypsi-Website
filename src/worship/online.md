### How to Engage Online

Worshiping online doesn't mean worshiping alone. Here are ways to engage:

**Before the Service:**
- Find a quiet, comfortable space
- Light a candle to mark this as sacred time
- Have communion elements ready if you'd like to participate (bread and juice/wine)
- Grab your Bible or open a Bible app

**During the Service:**
- Sing along with the worship songs
- Read Scripture aloud when prompted
- Participate in responsive readings
- Take communion when we do (all are welcome!)
- Use the chat/comments to share prayer requests or greetings

**After the Service:**
- Share your reflections in the comments
- Connect with others who worshiped online
- Reach out if you have questions or prayer needs

### Online Community

Worshiping online doesn't mean you're disconnected from community. We'd love to help you:

- Join a virtual community group
- Connect with others who worship online
- Schedule a video call with our pastor
- Find ways to serve from home
