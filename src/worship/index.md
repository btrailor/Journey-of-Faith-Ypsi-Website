### What is Worship?

Worship is our response to God's love and grace. In our gatherings, we:

- Sing songs of praise and lament
- Hear Scripture read and proclaimed
- Share communion together
- Pray for our community and world
- Experience God's presence through the Holy Spirit

We believe worship should engage our whole selves - heart, mind, soul, and strength. Our services blend ancient practices with contemporary expressions, creating space for all to encounter the living God.
