## Video Recommendations

For best results:

- **Duration**: 10-15 seconds each
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB per video for fast loading

## Optimization Tips

1. Compress videos before uploading (use tools like HandBrake or online compressors)
