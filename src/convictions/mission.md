Journey of Faith is *developing a community of disciples of Jesus Christ who, in partnership with others, actively engage in social justice, mutual support, and spiritual development.*

We sum this mission up with three short statements: *“Christ in All. Communion for All. Connecting with All.”*

## "Christ in All" - Spiritual Formation

**Growing as disciples of Jesus**

We believe spiritual formation is a lifelong journey of becoming more like Christ, and learning to see and love that of *Christ in all*. Spiritual development happens in worship, in social justice work, in personal spiritual practices, and learning from one another in our community groups

## "Communion for All" - Mutual Care

**Sharing joys and burdens with one another**

We always offer *communion for all*. We remember that on the night Jesus was betrayed, Jesus was willing to welcome the disciple who betrayed him at the communion table. This reminds us that we are called to welcome and care for all. This begins at the table as we remember Christ’s courageous, self-giving love and commit to **mutually supporting** those who gather for the bread and cup that nourishes both body and spirit. We also seek to extend the mutual care we experience at the table into the world through our social justice work. [](/community/)

## "Connecting with All" - Social Justice

**Partnering for justice in our community**

We believe the Gospel calls us to work for justice, particularly on behalf of those who are marginalized or vulnerable. We believe that **social justice** is best done by *connecting with all*. We don’t try to solve other people’s problems. We aren’t anyone’s savior! We seek to work with and support the organizations that have already gained trust in the community (like [FedUp,](https://fedupministries.org/) [Peace House Ypsi,](https://peacehouseypsi.org/) and [Alpha House](https://www.alphahouse-ihn.org/)) and connect with grassroots organizers that are working for their own community’s well-being (like community groups in West Willow and the Homelessness Solidarity Network). The non-profit we started,[ A Servant’s Heart,](https://aservantsheart.community/) provides backbone support for grassroots community organizations through grant-writing and other behind the scenes work.
