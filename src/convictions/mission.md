## The Mission We Do

Our mission is lived out through three interconnected practices, each reflecting a core aspect of following Jesus:

---

## "Christ in All" - Spiritual Formation

**Growing as disciples of Jesus**

We believe spiritual formation is a lifelong journey of becoming more like Christ. This happens through intentional practices and relationships that help us encounter God and grow in faith.

### Our Practices:

**Mentoring**
- One-on-one spiritual direction and discipleship relationships
- Pairing seekers with mature believers for guidance on the faith journey
- Intergenerational mentoring that builds wisdom and connection

**Community Groups**
- Small groups for deeper relationships and spiritual growth
- Bible study, prayer, and mutual encouragement
- Contexts for wrestling with faith questions together

**Worship**
- Weekly gatherings centered on encountering God
- Practices of prayer, Scripture, communion, and song
- Creating space for the Holy Spirit to move

## "Communion for All" - Mutual Care

**Sharing joys and burdens together**

Following Jesus means bearing one another's burdens and celebrating together. We are committed to being a community that truly cares for one another.

### Our Practices:

**Sharing Joys and Burdens**
- Creating space in worship and community to share what's happening in our lives
- Praying for and supporting one another in times of need
- Celebrating milestones and answered prayers together

**Story Circles**
- Gatherings where we share our stories and listen deeply
- Building empathy and understanding through narrative
- Recognizing God's work in one another's lives

**Community Meals**

## "Connecting with All" - Social Justice

**Partnering for justice in our community**

We believe the Gospel calls us to work for justice, particularly on behalf of those who are marginalized or vulnerable. We partner with local organizations to address real needs in our community.

### Our Focus Areas:

**Poverty**
- Partnering with organizations addressing economic inequality
- Supporting those experiencing housing and food insecurity
- Advocating for systemic change

**Elder Care**
- Ministry with and for elderly members of our community
- Addressing isolation and practical needs
- Honoring the wisdom and dignity of our elders

## Living the Mission

These three strands - spiritual formation, mutual care, and social justice - are woven together in the life of Journey of Faith. We believe authentic discipleship includes all three:

- We can't grow spiritually without caring for others
- We can't truly care for our community without working for justice
- We can't pursue justice without being rooted in Christ

This holistic approach to mission reflects our conviction that God's kingdom touches every aspect of life.
