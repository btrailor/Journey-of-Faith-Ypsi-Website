## The Values We Pursue

These core values guide how we relate to God, one another, and our community.

---

### Transformative Love

**Love that changes everything**

We believe in a love that transforms lives. This isn't passive or sentimental love, but the radical, self-giving love of Jesus that breaks down barriers, heals wounds, and creates new possibilities.

We pursue:
- Loving God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength
- Loving our neighbors as ourselves
- Extending love even to those who are difficult to love
- Allowing God's love to transform us from the inside out

---

### Inclusivity

**All are welcome, all belong**

Following Jesus' example of radical hospitality, we strive to be a community where everyone is welcomed, valued, and belongs - regardless of background, identity, or where they are on their faith journey.

We pursue:
- Creating space for all people to encounter God
- Celebrating the diversity of God's image in humanity
- Breaking down barriers that divide
- Listening to and learning from those whose experiences differ from our own

---

### Curiosity

**Questions welcome, wonder encouraged**

We believe faith and questions are not enemies. God invites us to engage our minds fully, to ask hard questions, and to explore the mysteries of faith with wonder and humility.

We pursue:
- Honest questioning and intellectual engagement with faith
- Learning from diverse perspectives and traditions
- Growth through exploration and discovery
- A faith that is thoughtful, not thoughtless

---

### Humility

**We don't have all the answers**

We recognize our own limitations and the danger of thinking we have everything figured out. Humility opens us to learn from others and to be transformed by God's Spirit.

We pursue:
- Recognizing we see "through a glass darkly"
- Listening before speaking
- Admitting when we're wrong
- Valuing wisdom from unexpected places
- Depending on God rather than our own understanding

---

### Creativity

**Made in the image of the Creator**

We believe creativity reflects the image of God in us. We embrace innovation, artistry, and fresh expressions of faith as we seek to faithfully follow Jesus in our time and place.

We pursue:
- Worship that engages the whole person
- New ways of doing ministry that serve our context
- The arts as a means of encountering the divine
- Innovation in how we live out our mission

These values aren't just words on a page - they shape our decisions, our relationships, and our ministry. We won't always live them perfectly, but they represent the kind of community we're committed to becoming.
