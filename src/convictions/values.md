### *Above all else:* Transformative Love

Journey of Faith’s values are always guided by **Transformative Love:** *embodying a profound, Christ-like love that inspires positive change in individuals, our community, and the world.*

Love always advocates for a person’s well-being and develops affection for the unique person God created them to be. Journey of Faith values a lot of things: \
\
diversity and unity, \
studying scripture and honoring our personal experiences, \
mutual caring for each other and encouraging personal responsibility, \
expressing faith and sharing doubts, \
proclaiming the gospel boldly and respecting people of other faiths and beliefs

…to name a few. \
\
These values can create tensions. We seek to navigate those tensions by always prioritizing *loving* the person or people we are engaging: seeking to understand one another, considering each other’s well-being, developing affection for one another, and encouraging everyone to work for the good of others. \
\
Below is a (not nearly exhaustive) list of some other values we share (in no particular order), but **transformative love** is always the measure.

### Inclusivity

**All are welcome, all belong**

Following Jesus' example of radical hospitality, we strive to be a community where everyone is welcomed, valued, and belongs - regardless of background, gender-identity, sexual orientation, ability, or where they are on their faith journey. We seek to grow in welcoming others and fostering belonging.

### Curiosity

**Questions welcome, wonder encouraged**

We believe faith and questions are not enemies. God invites us to engage our minds fully, to ask hard questions, earnestly seek new insights, and to explore the mysteries of faith with wonder and humility. We hope that you will find Journey of Faith to be a safe place for your questions and your reflections as you walk this journey of faith.

### Humility

**We don't have all the answers**

We recognize our own limitations and the danger of thinking we have everything figured out. Humility isn't self-flagellation or false modestly. It is recognizing that we see "through a glass darkly" and need each other's experiences and insight. We encourage congregants to practice listening well, acknowledge what we don't know, and admit when we are wrong. Humility opens us to learn from others and to be transformed by God's Spirit.

### Creativity

**Made in the image of the Creator**

We believe creativity reflects the image of God in us. We embrace innovation, artistry, and fresh expressions of faith as we seek to faithfully follow Jesus in our time and place. We know that God can connect with us in various ways, so we love expressions of worship that engage our whole bodies: our sight, our voices and ears, our hands and our feet. We seek to do ministry in creative, new ways, so bring your ideas and unique voice!

These values aren't just words on a page - they shape our decisions, our relationships, and our ministry. We won't always live them perfectly, but we seek to grow in our love for each other and God through pursuing these values.
