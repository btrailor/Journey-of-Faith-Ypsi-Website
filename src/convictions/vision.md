## The Vision We Share

### Rooted in the Biblical Story

[Explain how you understand and engage with Scripture as the foundation of your faith]

We believe the Bible tells the ongoing story of God's love for creation and God's work to redeem and restore all things. We seek to understand our lives as part of this larger narrative.

### Faith in the Gospel

[Describe your understanding of the Gospel and what it means to have faith in Jesus]

The good news of Jesus Christ is at the center of our faith. Through Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, God has made a way for us to be reconciled to God and to one another.

### Living Towards God's Kingdom

[Explain your vision of God's kingdom and how you seek to live it out]

We believe God's kingdom is both present now and coming in fullness. We are called to be signs of this kingdom - living with justice, peace, and love as we await Christ's return.

### Journey of Faith as an Outpost of God's Kingdom

[Describe how your congregation serves as an outpost of God's kingdom in your community]

Journey of Faith exists to be a tangible expression of God's kingdom in our neighborhood. We seek to:

- Create spaces where all people can encounter God's love
- Practice the radical hospitality of Jesus
- Work for justice and healing in our community
- Point people to the hope we have in Christ

This vision shapes everything we do, from how we worship together to how we engage with our neighbors.
