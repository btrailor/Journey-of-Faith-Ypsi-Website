**How much should I give?**

We encourage everyone to prayerfully consider what God is calling them to give. Some practice tithing (10% of income), while others give differently based on their circumstances. What matters most is that your giving is:

- Between you and God

Generosity is not primarily about the church's budget - it's about spiritual formation. When we give generously, we:

- Grow in trust and gratitude
- Break the power of money over our lives
- Align our resources with our values
- Participate in something bigger than ourselves

We invite you to grow in the practice of generosity, not out of obligation, but as a response to God's abundant grace.
