## Ministry for the Elderly

We honor the wisdom, dignity, and gifts of our elderly community members. Our ministry seeks to combat isolation, provide practical support, and build intergenerational connections.

---

### Why Elder Care Matters

Too many seniors in our community face:
- Social isolation and loneliness
- Difficulty with daily tasks
- Limited mobility and access to services
- Financial vulnerability
- Lack of family support nearby

Scripture calls us to honor and care for the elderly:

> "Stand up in the presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly and revere your God. I am the Lord." - Leviticus 19:32

> "Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you." - Isaiah 46:4
