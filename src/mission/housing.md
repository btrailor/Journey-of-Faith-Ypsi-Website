### Why This Matters

In Matthew 25, Jesus identifies himself with those who are hungry, thirsty, strangers, naked, sick, and imprisoned. When we serve our unhoused neighbors, we serve Christ himself.

Housing insecurity isn't just a social issue - it's a justice issue that the church is called to address. Every person deserves:
- A safe place to sleep
- Access to basic necessities
- Dignity and respect
- A community that cares
