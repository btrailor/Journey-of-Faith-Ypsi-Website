### Why We Do Mission

Mission work isn't optional for followers of Jesus. Scripture is clear:

> "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow." - Isaiah 1:17

> "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." - Matthew 25:40

When we serve those in need, we encounter Christ. When we work for justice, we participate in God's kingdom.
