### Pastor

**Pastor Sarah Lynne**

Rev. Sarah Lynne Gershon is our pastor. She offers guidance to our lay leadership and oversees church staff. She loves chatting about the bible and theology, singing from the Sacred Harp as often as possible, and hosting people in her home. 

Sarah Lynne grew up in a large evangelical church in Orlando, FL.  After reading through the gospels for the first time in high school, and catching Jesus’ vision of “good news for the poor,” she was sent on a journey that led her to move to Minneapolis to join the Catholic Worker, an intentional community (unaffiliated with the Roman Catholic church) where members offer beds in their homes for people who would otherwise be without housing.  

Sarah Lynne met her husband Brett in Minneapolis. Later they and their two children, Alasdair and Iver, moved to the Bloomington, IN Catholic Worker and lived there for 7 years.  Since then she has developed a passion for Christian faith formation, worship, and service. Recognizing a call to pastoral ministry, Sarah Lynne began studying at Christian Theological Seminary in 2018 and graduated in 2024 with Masters of Divinity and Masters of Theology degrees.  

After accepting a call as First Christian Church Bloomington’s Associate Pastor, Brett and Sarah Lynne left the Bloomington Catholic Worker and began focusing on church ministry. She oversaw the formation of a weekly free community meal that provided nourishment for over 100 people each week. She also oversaw the formation of an emergency winter shelter hosted by multiple churches and run entirely by volunteers. On dangerously cold nights, this shelter provides a warm bed for people who can’t (or won’t) use the year-around shelters. 

Sarah Lynne and Journey of Faith share a vision for justice, a desire to work with grassroots organizations, and a commitment to ministry with marginalized people–especially as it relates to poverty, racism, LGBTQ+ identities, mental health, and homelessness. She was delighted when she was called as the minister to Journey of Faith (beginning on Sept, 2025) as they replant in eastern Ypsi.

### Members

Authority in our church ultimately rests with its members. They elect representatives to the church council for limited terms and there are some decisions that need approval by the membership at a congregational meeting. Members are individuals who decide to trust Jesus as their savior and make a commitment to follow Jesus in this particular congregation. We invite anyone who attends the church to make that commitment. You are welcome to join us!

### Church Council

 Our church council has a minimum of 3 members of the church, with provisions to expand with the growth of our ministries and congregation. As of the writing of this page, we have 5 council members representing elders, deacons, our mission team, and financial officers.

### Elders & Deacons

Elders oversee the spiritual well-being of our community and deacons oversee its physical well-being. They don’t just *do*, but lead others to grow in mutual support of one another. Elders and Deacon oversee our weekly communion during worship. The bread and cup that we share together at the Table reminds us to love one another (as Christ loves us) through both physical and spiritual support.

### Staff

We currently have two musicians on staff, leading us in worship each Sunday

**Dave French** There is a gospel song that goes something like this:  

*Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Give me the words that will bring new life
Words on the wings of a morning, the dark night will fade away
If You speak to my heart now …*

When the words don’t come, the music might just touch the heart in a way that words can’t.

World-renowned, contemporary hymn writers, Keith and Kristin Getty have said that:  “The very act of congregational worship is a symbol of unity.  At a theological level, we are looking forward to the picture of Heaven where every tribe, tongue, nation, and language will sing before their Maker.”

At a very practical level though it is actually on a Sunday morning, reminding each other, encouraging one another, empowering one another by singing to one another.  The music of Rachel and Dave creates space for making a call to every one of us to live the gospel and fully participate in our faith.  Fully participating in the music is a great way to do that.

Dave’s an accomplished guitarist.  He has blessed the worship service with their improvisational playing of favorite hymns or a contemporary song.  It’s like watching and feeling the Spirit move within and among you.  For Dave, music is at the heart of worship.  

And, for those of us sitting in the pews or chairs — music is one of the most beautiful forms of prayer.  Whether we sing in a group or just listen, music touches all of us in a deep and meaningful way.  We can express our love, joy, and our sorrow through music.   We appreciate the gifts that Dave shares with this congregation — his prayers are beautiful even without saying a word.

*"Maybe it’s why there’s an ancient proverb that says, “To sing is to pray twice.”."  —Dave*
