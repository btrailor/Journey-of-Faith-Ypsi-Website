### Who We Are

Journey of Faith is a small church developing disciples through spiritual formation, mutual support, and social justice. We believe that Christ's love transforms lives and communities and the whole world (heck even the whole COSMOS) as it breaks down the social barriers that divide us, inspires us to change the systems that harm us, heals every wound, and wipes away every tear (Rev 21:4).\
\
JoF has a long history of working for positive change and healing (our first life was as Memorial Christian Church in Ann Arbor). We helped start the Interfaith Hospitality Network, hosted the daytime warming center, supported Peace House Catholic Worker and more. We are now relaunching on the east side of Ypsi, with a vision for a new building that will be better suited to our mission of spiritual formation, mutual support, and social justice. It's been a beautiful journey. Come join us on the path! \

And just to be clear, when we say ALL we mean ALL. We celebrate God's people in all their diversity: in all our varying genders, sexualities, ethnicities, and abilities.
