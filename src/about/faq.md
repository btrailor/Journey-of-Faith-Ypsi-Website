### General Questions

**What should I expect when I visit?**

You should expect a worship service that engages scripture and invites you to praise God through a mix of contemporary songs, gospel music, and traditional hymns, with preaching that inspires and challenges you to follow Jesus and a time of prayer. We like to be creative in worship, so sometimes there are also prayer stations or an activity. We are generally a friendly group and we are small, so you can expect people to introduce themselves and welcome you. We have coffee fellowship afterwards and would love to get to know you. 

**What should I wear?**

Whatever you want! Assuming it’s appropriate for the public of course :) Jeans, shorts, dresses, a tux or an evening gown. If your kid loves wearing PJ’s, they can even come in their “comfy-cozies.” It’s totally up to you! Most people wear casual, everyday clothing to worship at Journey of Faith. 

**Is childcare available?**

We do not have a separate program during worship for our kids. We want children to feel welcome and included in our worship. Our children are invited to read the scripture and call to worship, and help serve communion. We always provide an area for kids to keep their hands busy and are continually learning how to practice biblical story-telling and provide teaching in worship that connects with people of all ages.

We believe children belong in worship and expect them to make joyful noise! Don't worry if your little one is restless - we're glad you're here.

### Beliefs & Theology

**What do you believe?**

The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) embraces a diversity of theological perspectives within a shared commitment to follow Jesus as Lord and proclaim him as savior. Members of our congregation make that profession of faith (Jesus is Lord and savior). They have varying ways of understanding that commitment. As a church we are guided by our vision, mission, and values. You can read about [our convictions here.](jofypsi.com/convictions)

We are apart of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world. You can read more about [our denomination here.](https://disciples.org/)
