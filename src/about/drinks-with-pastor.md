Got questions? Want to connect? Curious about faith? Pastor Sarah Lynne would love to take you out for a drink and get to know you more.

### What Is This?

Drinks with the Pastor is an informal, low-pressure opportunity to connect with our pastor in a relaxed setting. Whether you're exploring faith for the first time, new to Journey of Faith, or a longtime member, you're welcome to grab a drink and have a conversation.

### Topics We Can Discuss

* Questions about faith, God, Jesus, the Bible
* Journey of Faith and what we're about
* Life, struggles, celebrations
* Theology and hard questions
* How to get connected at Journey of Faith
* Literally anything else on your mind that relates to following Jesus or Journey of Faith

No topic is off limits, and there's no pressure to have it all figured out. 

### How to Connect

**Email** [pastorsarahlynne@gmail.com](mailto:pastorsarahlynne@gmail.com) or **text** (734) 829-8357 letting her know you would like to grab a drink and chat. Send her 3 times you are available to meet and she will schedule a time. 

### What to Expect

* Casual conversation in a public setting
* Your choice of beverage (coffee, tea, beer, soda, etc… just no shots, please!)
* 60-90 minutes
* Zero judgment, total confidentiality
* A safe place to ask questions, explore faith, and seek truth… even when we don’t have all the answers

Looking forward to connecting with you!
